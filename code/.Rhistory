## Motivation
In the 2016-2017 season, the Warriors made history. They had the longest winning streak in the postseason, and scored the most three-pointers in the NBA Finals quarter and half games. What is their secret to consistently being one of the best teams in the NBA? Basketball is simple; the more shots you score, the better your team.
It is no secret that the Warriors have some of the best players who can shoot. According to SB Nation, Steph Curry is just as effective shooting across 30 feet when shooting from 3 feet.
```{r out.width='80%', echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/curry.jpg")
```
Is this true? Let us look at the best five ranked players from the 2016-17 season (in order): Klay Thompson, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, and Andre Iguodala. We will dissect just how effective these players are, and if they are just as effective shooting across different distances from the hoop: success percentages of 2-pointers, 3-pointers, and overall.
These approaches will be made from a statistical perspective, by using R, the official coding program for statisticians. The article will be divided into 7 parts: Motivation, Background, Data, Analysis, Discussion, Conclusion, and References. In the Data section, the article will include chunks of code where statistical calculations are made.
## Background
Before we start, here's a bit of background on these top 5 players, also known as the "Hampton 5" lineup. First on the list, Kevin Durant was the NBA finals MVP and one of the league's best players the two seasons he was with the Golden State in 2016. Iguodala is one of the oldest players on the team, but still remains one of the best. Klay Thompson is a four-time All Star who is one of the best shooters ever in Golden State Warrior history. Stephen Curry had not yet reached his peak in 2016; still, he is one of the best shooters in 2016. Draymond Green is the last on the list and admittedly not the strongest offense, as he is known for his amazing defense.
## Data
Here, we can see a general overview of the overall effectiveness of the top 5 Warrior players:
### Effective Shooting % by Player
```{r, echo=FALSE}
effective_overall <- shots_data %>%
group_by(shots_data$name) %>%
summarize(
total = length(shot_type),
made = sum(shot_made_flag == "shot_yes"),
perc_made = made / total
) %>%
arrange(desc(perc_made))
effective_overall
```
The overall effectiveness includes shots made from 2-pointers as well as 3-pointers. As you can see, Kevin Durant is at the top of the list, with an impressive 54% success rate.
Andre Iguodala, who comes just after him with a 52% success rate, doesn't make as many shot attempts during games. In fact, he attempts just about a third of number of shots as Durant does -- while Durant attempts 915, Iguodala attempts 317. He is a sniper with incredible precision.
Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson show similar stats in the shots they attempt and make. Draymon Green is a rising sniper in the list; he doens't attempt too many shots, but makes a good amount of them (42%).
But just how many of these shots are from 2-pointers and 3-pointers? The data char
### 2 PT Effective Shooting % by Player
```{r, echo = FALSE}
effective_2pt <- shots_data %>%
group_by(shots_data$name) %>%
summarize(
total = sum(shot_type == "2PT Field Goal"),
made = sum(shot_made_flag == "shot_yes" &
shot_type == "2PT Field Goal"),
perc_made = made / total
) %>%
arrange(desc(perc_made))
```
```{r}
effective_2pt
```
### 3 PT Effective Shooting % by Player
```{r, echo=FALSE}
effective_3pt <- shots_data %>%
group_by(shots_data$name) %>%
summarize(
total = sum(shot_type == "3PT Field Goal"),
made = sum(shot_made_flag == "shot_yes" &
shot_type == "3PT Field Goal"),
perc_made = made / total
) %>%
arrange(desc(perc_made))
```
```{r}
effective_3pt
```
### Analysis
Taking the data from the 5 players, we can make a visual graph that shows us where exactly shots were attempted, and if the players succeeded.
```{r out.width='80%', echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/gsw_shot_charts.png")
```
The above chart shows if the players made shot attempts from 2-pointers and 3-pointers. The dots in green show if the shots succeeded, and the dots in red show if the shots failed.
Let's dig into the the analysis in detail. Each player has their strengths and weakensses. Shown from the data tables from the Data section, each player shows different success percentages depending on if they are shooting from a 2-pointer or a 3-pointer.
First, let's take a look at Klay Thompson.
```{r out.width='80%', echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/klay-thompson-shot-chart.png")
```
Thompson's effectiveness is 51% when shooting from a 2-pointer. His effectiveness drops by 10% when shooting from a 3-pointer, to almost 42%.
Next is Stephen Curry.
```{r out.width='80%', echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/stephen-curry-shot-chart.png")
```
Curry's effectiveness becomes similarly affected by distance as Thompson's. His effectiveness from a 2-pointer is 54%, while from a 3-pointer drops it a bit over 10%, to 41%.
The next player under the microscope is Kevin Durant.
```{r out.width='80%', echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/kevin-durant-shot-chart.png")
```
As seen from the data chart, Kevin Durant's success rate when shooting from a 3-pointer is 39%. However, his success rate when shooting from a 2-pointer is 61%. The success rate nearly doubles when he moves closer to the rim.
Draymond Green, the weakest shooter out of the top 5, shows similar results as Curry and Thompson.
```{r out.width='80%', echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/draymond-green-shot-chart.png")
```
His success rate from a 2-pointer is 49%. For Green,  the difference is a bit more than 10% -- from a 3 pointer, his effectiveness drops to 32%.
The last player on our list, Iguodala, has the highest effectiveness shooting from a 2-pointer: 64%. However, like Durant, this drops significantly when shooting from a 3-pointer: to 36%.
```{r out.width='80%', echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/andre-iguodala-shot-chart.png")
```
What is interesting about Durant and Iguodala is that overall, they are the top 2 players from the team; however, they are both significantly affected by the distance they are shooting from.
### Discussion
All players were affected by distance; all five showed better effectiveness when shotting from a 2-pointer than 3-pointer. However, Durant, the strongest player with the most success rate out of the 5 top players, was the most affected by this change, by showing nearly double the effectiveness when he moves to a 2-pointer.
### Conclusion
Overall, this exploration showed that it does not matter whether a player can make more shots from further away; rather, what matters is who makes the most shots, close or far. Moreover, it shows that the players who are able to shoot most from a 2-pointer (with a great gap between their score from a 3-pointer) will be more valuable to the team.
### Summary
TOp GWS players have great disparity between their 2-point and 3-point shoot success rates; however, their rate of success shooting from 2-pointers is what makes them the greatest in their team.

made = sum(shot_made_flag == "shot_yes"),
perc_made = made / total
) %>%
arrange(desc(perc_made))
```
```{r}
effective_overall
```
The overall effectiveness includes shots made from 2-pointers as well as 3-pointers. As you can see, Kevin Durant is at the top of the list, with an impressive 54% success rate.
Andre Iguodala, who comes just after him with a 52% success rate, doesn't make as many shot attempts during games. In fact, he attempts just about a third of number of shots as Durant does -- while Durant attempts 915, Iguodala attempts 317. He is a sniper with incredible precision.

But just how many of these shots are from 2-pointers and 3-pointers?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
effective_2pt <- shots_data %>%
group_by(shots_data$name) %>%
summarize(
total = sum(shot_type == "2PT Field Goal"),
made = sum(shot_made_flag == "shot_yes" &
shot_type == "2PT Field Goal"),
perc_made = made / total
) %>%
arrange(desc(perc_made))
```
```{r}
effective_2pt
```
### 3 PT Effective Shooting % by Player
```{r, echo=FALSE}
effective_3pt <- shots_data %>%
group_by(shots_data$name) %>%
summarize(
total = sum(shot_type == "3PT Field Goal"),
made = sum(shot_made_flag == "shot_yes" &
shot_type == "3PT Field Goal"),
perc_made = made / total
) %>%
arrange(desc(perc_made))
```
```{r}
effective_3pt
```
### Analysis
First, let's take a look at Klay Thompson.
Thompson's effectiveness is 51% when shooting from a 2-pointer. His effectiveness drops by 9% when shooting from a 3-pointer, to almost 42%. From a visual chart, we can see exactly from where he made his shots:
```{r out.width='80%', echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/klay-thompson-shot-chart.png")
```
As expected from the top player on the list, many of his shots are from both from the 2-pointer and 3-pointer. The green dots show where he made his shots, and the red ones show where his attempts failed. Much of his shots from 3-pointers are concentrated from the right and left around the ring, and down a straight path in the middle.
Next is Stephen Curry.
```{r out.width='80%', echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/stephen-curry-shot-chart.png")
```
Curry's effectiveness becomes similarly affected by distance as Thompson's, if not more. His effectiveness from a 2-pointer is 54%, while from a 3-pointer drops 13%, to 41%. He makes the most shots
The next player under the microscope is Kevin Durant.
As seen from the data chart, Kevin Durant's success rate when shooting from a 3-pointer is 39%. However, his success rate when shooting from a 2-pointer is 61%. The success rate nearly doubles when he moves closer to the rim.

Draymond Green, the weakest shooter out of the top 5, shows similar results as Curry and Thompson.
```{r out.width='80%', echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/draymond-green-shot-chart.png")

His success rate from a 2-pointer is 49%. For Green,  the difference is a bit more than 10% -- from a 3 pointer, his effectiveness drops to 32%.
